Updates in CLI Flasher v1.8.0
==============================

* When detecting an SPI/SQI flash, detect and display the 
  device name and its JEDEC ID, when possible.

* WFP improvement: Added the read command. It allows to read data from 
  the flash controlled by a WFP control file and store the resulting 
  files in a WFP directory.

Romloader 2.5.2-dev3:
* Changed wording of some messages during chip type detection
  more uniform messages
  mention when chip type is potentially incorrect
  mention open/secure boot mode

* UART machine interface:
  During the connection setup, when the netx is repeatedly sending a packet
  because it is waiting for an ack packet, send a cancel_operation request.

* Update SIPper to v0.2.3
  Changed uart_handler to version 1.2.1
  Added support of new uart_handler receive routine to make the communication more robust

Updates in CLI Flasher v1.7.1
==============================

* Added support for chip types:
  netX 90 Rev1 with PHY v3 (Step C)
  netX 90 Rev2 (Step D)

* netx 90 Rev1 and Rev2: When the netx is in the UART terminal console,
  send a reset command which allows us to enter the machine interface.
  (Previously, a manual reset was required).



Updates in CLI Flasher v1.7.0
==============================

* USIP Player improvements:
  When the command line option '--force_console' is present, 
  scan only for UART interfaces as the interface must be UART.
  When the command line option '--extend_exec' is present, 
  scan only for JTAG interfaces as the interface must be JTAG.

  Speed up scanning for interfaces by not scanning on ethernet.

* Update SIPper to v0.2.1
  Bugfix in analyze command.




Updates in CLI Flasher v1.6.3
==============================

* CLI Flasher bugfix (NXTFLASHER-360):
  netx 90 internal flash:
  After accessing the bank 1 info page (-b 2 -u 1 -cs 1 or 2),	
  a subsequent access to bank 3 (-b 2 -u 3) 
  may return incorrect results or crash.
  This does not occur when a reset was performed after accessing 
  the info page.
	
* USIP player:
  This is an extension that allows access to the secure info pages and 
  execution of USIP images on the netX 90.

  usip                  Load an usip file on the netX, reset the netX and 
                        process the usip file to update the SecureInfoPage.
  verify                Verify the content of a usip file against the 
                        content of a secure info page.
  read                  Read out the content of the secure infopage and 
                        save it into a temporary folder.
  set_sip_protection    Set the SipProtectionCookie, enable protection of SIPs.
  detect_secure_mode    Detect the secure mode of the netX. 
  get_uid               Get the unique ID.

  Example:
  lua5.1 usip_player.lua -h

* Moved to OpenOCD 0.11.0/libUSB 1.0.24
  Change in output formatting:
  Trace messages passed up from the flasher running on the netX that previously
  ended with a double line break, now end with a single line break.
  Some trace messages from OpenOCD itself, e.g. register writes, that previously
  ended with a single line break, now end with a double line break.
  
* JTAG: Add support for the netSHIELD 90 board 

* Initialize the netIOL PLL

* Improved stability of machine interface protocol 

* JTAG: Disable breakpoints after running the flasher on netX  

* JTAG: Update attach/reset procedure for netx 90:
  Remove early breakpoint at 0x170
  This breakpoint can be enabled manually in jtag_detect_init.tcl
  Abort with an error if the CPU cannot be halted.

* reset_netx 
  This new command allows to reset the netX.
  It works by triggering a watchdog reset.
  This means that it does not require a hardware reset line, but does require
  that the netX is accessible via a machine interface connection or via JTAG.
  Limitation: When using JTAG, this command only supports the netX 90.
  Example:
  lua5.1 cli_flash.lua reset_netx 
  
* JTAG reset mode
  This option allows selecting if/how the netX is reset when connecting
  via JTAG:
  hard: reset the netX using the SRST line of the JTAG adapter (default)
  soft: reset the netX using the DPM reset request
  attach: do not reset the netX
  Example:
  lua5.1 cli_flash.lua flash -jtag_reset hard -b 1 data.bin
  
* JTAG frequency 
  This option allows selecting the frequency used for the JTAG interface.
  Example:
  lua5.1 cli_flash.lua flash -jtag_khz 6000 -b 1 data.bin

* WFP: WFP files may contain multiple files with the same name
  under different paths.
  The file attribute of a Data node may now contain a filename with a path, if 
  the FlasherPackage node includes the attribute has_subdirs="True".

  When using 'has_subdirs' flag:
   - the whole file path inside the wfp-control file is used as reference to 
     check for multiple copies of the same file
   - the archive will be packed with a hierarchy
  When not using 'has_subdirs' flag:
   - only the file name will be used as a reference for checking for multiple 
     files with the same name
   - multiple files with the same name in different subdirs will lead to an 
     Error while packing
   - the archive will be packed with a flat hierarchy

* WFP verify bugfix: handle netx 90 intflash01 (-b 2 -u 3) correctly.

Other changes:

* Replace the netX4000 RELAXED with the netX4000 FULL

* Build the GPIO drivers on ARM platforms.



	
Updates in CLI flasher v1.6.2
==============================

* Specify interface type to speed up scanning for interfaces
  Both cli_flash.lua and wfp.lua now support the command line argument 
  -t <plugin type> to specify the interface type.
  This can speed up the scanning process.
  
  Example:
  lua5.1 cli_flash.lua list_interfaces -t romloader_uart

  The following interface types exist:
  romloader_uart 
  romloader_usb 
  romloader_jtag
  romloader_eth

  -t may be combined with -p (specifying the interface name).

* If an isErased check fails, the device offset of the first 
  non-erased location is printed.

* Bugfix: Verify error offset 
  The verify function for serial flash reported an incorrect offset when a difference was found. (cli_flash.lua)


Changes specific to JTAG:

* Add support for the Segger J-Link JTAG adapter.
  Support has been added for the following variants:
  VID 0x1366 PID 0x0101 
  VID 0x1366 PID 0x0105 
  
* Add support for the NXEB 90-SPE board.

* Change the interface name of the NXHX90-DRIVE board to NXHX90-MC.

* Removed delays in JTAG memory access functions. Poll faster for messages.

* Bugfix: Spike on nSRST line
  Fix a spike on the reset line that occurred on the nSRST line on FTDI-based
  JTAG adapters when a reset was triggered.
  
  This change affects the following boards:
  NXHX 90-JTAG
  NXHX 90-MC
  NXHX 90-SPE
  NRPEB H90-RE
  and the following adapters:
  NXJTAG-USB 
  NXJTAG-4000-USB



Changes specific to WFP:

* Add the verify command to check if a WFP was written to flash correctly.

* Add "conditions" to the flash and verify commands
  Conditions are variables that are set via the command line as key=value pairs. 
  The instructions in the wfp.xml control file can be made dependent on the 
  values of these variables.
  For instance, this allows to use a single WFP file to flash different 
  hardware configurations or firmware variants.

* Add the 'erase' command to the wfp.xml control file.

* Add simple WFPs
  Add the flag -s/--simple to the pack command. 
  This will create a SWFP file without compression.

* Add version command 
  Using the command -v or --version

* It is now possible to use subdirectories in wfp.xml

* Bugfix: wfp.lua returns return code 1 in case of errors.
